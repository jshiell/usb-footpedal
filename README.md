# USB Footpedal

This is the CircuitPython implementation of a USB foot pedal. It's a _very_ mild extension of [this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/USB-foot-switch-circuit-python/software), with added lights and turning off the USB drive.

This code is for [CircuitPython 8.1.0](https://circuitpython.org/board/trinket_m0/).
